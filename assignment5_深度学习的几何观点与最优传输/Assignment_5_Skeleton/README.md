# Computational Conformal Geometry Homework

This C++ project framework is used to help students to implement geometric algorithms.

## System

The code has been tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 and MacOS 10.15.5, if there is any problem, please let me know.

## Directory Structure

``` txt
ot_2d                    -- Folder for planar optimal transportation, semi-discrete algorithm. 
data                     -- Some models.
CMakeLists.txt           -- CMake configuration file.
resources                -- Some resources needed.
3rdparty                 -- MeshLib, freeglut, Eigen and detri2 libraries.
```

## Configuration

Follow the instruction in the README.md of each algorithm folder.
